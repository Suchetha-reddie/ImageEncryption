# Image Encryption: Securing Visual Data in the Digital Realm

This project demonstrates how to securely encrypt and decrypt image data using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in Python. It ensures that sensitive visual content remains protected from unauthorized access.

## 🔐 Features

- Encrypts any image file (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`) using AES encryption
- Decrypts the encrypted image back to its original form
- Simple GUI or CLI interface (if applicable)
- Secure key handling with random generation and storage

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- `cryptography` library (Fernet/AES)
- NumPy
- Pillow (optional)
